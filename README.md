### The files in this folder generates the site https://ltusps.github.io/

### The main page is index.html

### When creating a new page which you'd want to show as https://ltusps.github.io/<new-page> you should copy index.html into new-page-name.html within this folder. You'd then want to edit the new-page-name.html to make it look like the page that you want.

### It might be a good idea to use VSCode to edit the pages before you push it up to github
